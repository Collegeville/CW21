While interns are invaluable additions to teams by enabling focused work when other team members may be distracted with other duties, effecitvely integrating an intern for a short duration, such as a 12-week summer internship, can be challenging. 

With internships also serving an educational mission, balancing project impact against the best educational outcomes for students can be challenging. During this teatime session, we will discuss challenges and solutions when integrating interns into research teams.
