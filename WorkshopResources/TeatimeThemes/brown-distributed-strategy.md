# Forming team strategy without central control

*Teatime theme - Collegeville 2021*

Distributed multi-stakeholder teams have no centralized planning/funding, since there is no leader to set priorities or to hire strategically. Rather, leaders help define values and create social and technical infrastructure such that participation in the community becomes the best way for people to reach their own goals, from disparate project milestones to professional growth. 

What strategies work well in this environment? How can such teams effectively promote diversity and inclusive culture? How do such communities stay responsive to non-participating stakeholders, such as those impacted by technologies? At what scale should formal project governance be defined?
