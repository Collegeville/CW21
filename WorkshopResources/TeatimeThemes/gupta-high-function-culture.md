Research environments often have teams with diverse cultural backgrounds. Composite teams frequently have team members who have lived, grown up, studied or worked in various parts of the world.

The coming together of such diverse teammates brings together a plethora of cultural richness as well as conscious and subconscious working and interaction styles. How do such cultural backgrounds affect team productivity? Are we able to recognize, understand and overcome inherent cultural biases? Are we interested in learning the working and thinking styles of our teammates located in the other side of the world? How  do we enrich ourselves professionally as well as develop personally, as we work in diverse teams? 

If you work (or want to work) in a culturally diverse team, then this teatime session is for you. This session is open to anyone who wants to brainstorm, share ideas, and learn from each other on how to work towards effective culturally diverse teams.
