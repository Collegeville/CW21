# Different Types of Teams

*Teatime theme - Collegeville 2021*

*James Willenbring & Reed Milewicz - Sandia National Laboratories*

When software developers work together on a software product, the existence of a team is obvious. The benefits of working together effectively and the pains of not doing so are also obvious. Sometimes opportunities for teaming are less apparent. Examples of these situations include team of teams, teams within an organization, teams across organizations, and community teaming. We will discuss these alternative team formats, along with some of the benefits and challenges associated with each.

We are interested in learning from attendees how they have successfully built integrated teams of various kinds, as well as experiences where the challenges and costs of teaming have outweighed the benefits.
