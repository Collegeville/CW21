# Increasing understanding of scientific software teams

*Teatime theme - Collegeville 2021*

*Mike Heroux - St. John's, Sandia National Laboratories*

Almost all of us are members of software teams, or work with teams, or both. Yet there seems to be little formal discussion of how to characterize and improve team structure, activities and output.

In this teatime, we will brainstorm on how we can establish better focus on this topic.  How can we create forums for discussion?  Is there literature or content from other domains that can be leveraged by scientific teams? Which other software domains have similar needs and experience?
