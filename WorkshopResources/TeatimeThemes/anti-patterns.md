# When one member of the team wants more process than everyone else

*Teatime theme - Collegeville 2021*

*Anshu Dubey, Argonne National Lab*

Our very small team has encountered a situation where one member of the team would like
way more rigor in the process that the rest of the team would even like to consider. That in turn
brings in the thorny question of how much is too much and how little is too little. So far we
have navigated this space largely on my "gut feeling", but that is arbitrary, and I am not sure
that I have made the right choice. I would like to discuss with others who have faced similar
situations, especially where they are in the decision making seat and feel less than convinced
about their decisions.
