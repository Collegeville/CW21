# Incentivizing Software Quality Practices

*Teatime theme - Collegeville 2021*

*Elaine Raybourn, Miranda Mundt & Reed Milewicz - Sandia National Laboratories*

Many teams struggle to adapt and right-size software engineering best practices in quality to fit their context. Introducing software quality isn't usually framed in a way that motivates teams to take action, thus resulting in it becoming a “check the box for compliance” activity instead of a cultural practice which values software quality and the effort to achieve it. When and how can we provide effective incentives for software teams to adopt and integrate meaningful and enduring software quality practices?  To kick off the conversation the presenters will use breakout rooms and provide short vignettes. This teatime session is open to anyone who wants to brainstorm, share ideas, and learn from others!
