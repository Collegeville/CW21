# 2021 Collegeville Workshop on Scientific Software Report

There will be no official Collegeville 2021 workshop report.  Instead, we encourage participants to use their contributions as a starting point for publishing in other venues.  For example:
- CiSE - Computing in Science and Engineering
- BSSw.io - Better Scientific Software web portal
