# 2021 Collegeville Workshop on Scientific Software: Video Watch Parties

In order to provide opportunities for attendees to get a head start on workshop activities, we plan to encourage pre-workshop watch parties.  A watch party is an informal event via  a Zoom (or similar) session where attendees watch one or more of the Collegeville Workshop recordings.

If you are interested in organizing and hosting a watch party, please add your information in the following table by submitting a pull request.
