## Background

### What about software teams?
Very little scientific software is developed by indivdual scientists.  Instead, teams with diverse skills collaborate on producing and using software to advance scientific discovery and understanding.  

### Why we should focus on software teams
Understanding how teams function and how teamwork can be improved represents one of the frontiers in improving the impact of software on science. Software team skills and cultures can vary significantly.  A scientific software team will certainly have science domain experts but increasingly has expertise in computer science, mathematics and software engineering.  As we increase our focus on software teams, we also see value in including expertise in social and cognitive sciences.

### Diverse scientific software communities and institutions
One way to characterize the computational and data sciences communities is through their institutions.  Three distinct categories of institutions that develop, use and support scientific software are corporations, research labs and universities. Each category tends to have a distinct business model and set of priorities. However, the broad scientific software ecosystem is inter-dependent and complementary, where products from one category are widely used in others.  Even more interaction is possible if the scientific software community can come to understand commonalities and differences.
