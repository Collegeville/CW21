Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving software teams for scientific software is encouraged to submit content to build the program of Collegeville 2021.  We welcome the following contributions:

| Contribution| Submission Date | Description                                |

| White paper | June 18 | A brief document articulating impediments, challenges, opportunities or potential solutions to teams for scientific software. |
| Recorded presentation | June 21 - July 9 | We will work with you or accept short recorded presentations on content selected from some of the submitted white papers. If your white paper content would make a good presentation for the workshop, we will contact you to inquire if you are interested in this opportunity. Recorded presentations will be available to attendees before the workshop. |
| Teatime theme | July 1 |A topic related to software teams for open discussion during teatime. If your teatime theme is accepted, you would facilitate a small group discussion on the theme during the July 20 – 22 workshop. |
| Poster      |July 1  |A PDF or interactive webpage that will be the focus of small group discussion during teatime. If your poster is accepted, you would facilitate a small group discussion during the July 20 – 22 workshop.   |
| Watch party | July 12 - 19 | During the week prior to the workshop, participants can host a watch party for one or more of the workshop video recordings. See [this page](WorkshopResources/WatchParty/WatchPartyList.md) for details. |
Panelist |  July 20 - 22 | During the workshop dates of July 20 – 22, we will host a live plenary panel discussion with Q&A as the first event each day.  We are limited to just a few panelists each day and will invite people based on their white paper submission and the diversity of viewpoint for the theme of the day.  We will contact panelist candidates to inquire if you are interested in this opportunity. The panel sessions will be recorded and available after the workshop. |

**All submission will be reviewed by the organizing committee for possible acceptance to the workshop program**
